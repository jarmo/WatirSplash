== DESCRIPTION

WatirSplash makes browser-based web page testing in Ruby splashin' easy.
It combines Watir (http://www.watir.com) for controlling the browser and
RSpec (http://relishapp.com/rspec) for testing framework. This powerful combination gives you
the ability to write easily well-maintained and easy-to-read specs (specifications in RSpec) so
you don't need to have any extra documentation for your applications.

WatirSplash makes it easier to use best features of both of these tools together so
you won't have to spend time on thinking how to do that yourself - you can start
testing right away!

== SYNOPSIS

=== With vanilla Watir and RSpec
    require 'watir'
    require 'rspec'

    describe "Google" do
        before :all do
            @browser = Watir::Browser.new
            @browser.maximize
            @browser.goto "http://google.com"
            @browser.url.should =~ /google/
        end

        it "has search field" do
            text_field = @browser.text_field(:name => "q")
            text_field.should exist
            text_field.should be_visible
        end

        it "performs search" do
            @browser.text_field(:name => "q").set "Bing"
            @browser.button(:name => "btnG").click
            @browser.text.should include("Bing")
        end

        after :all do
            @browser.close
        end
    end

            text_field.should exist
            text_field.should be_visible
        end
        
        it "performs search" do
            text_field(:name => "q").set "Bing"
            button(:name => "btnG").click
            text.should include("Bing")

== SUPPORTED PLATFORMS & BROWSERS

WatirSplash supports different frameworks/browsers on different operating systems:
* Linux & OS X - firewatir, watir-webdriver/chrome and watir-webdriver/firefox
* Windows - firewatir, watir, watir-webdriver/chrome, watir-webdriver/ie, watir-webdriver/firefox

Each framework drives a specific browser:
* FireWatir - Firefox
* Watir - IE
* Watir-WebDriver - Chrome, IE and Firefox

It is possible to specify what framework to use in ui-test/config.rb and/or in ui-test-common/config.rb files:
    WatirSplash::Util.framework = "watir-webdriver/firefox"

If framework is not specified manually then a default framework will be used for the current platform.

PS! Please note that all frameworks are not 100% compatible with each other. If you find any concrete incompatibilities then
it would be great if you'd contribute fixes or information to the authors of the frameworks.
